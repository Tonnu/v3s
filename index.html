               <p>We believe that “finding the right people” is a statement that is grossly misunderstood. We still seem to live in a world with a factory worker mindset, where people are “hired” to do a “job”. A world wherein the output of every single person can be measured. Our brains seem to adapt too slowly to see that for the new generation, this mindset is wrong. No longer will people look for a “job” to do, instead they will look for fulfilment. No longer will output be predictable, no longer will it be measurable. </p>

               <p>A company’s success seems to be determined by the pace it’s growing. We do not believe in this kind hypergrowth. We believe that finding the right people to work with is a time consuming process. It’s not about a transaction, it’s about building a relationship. We believe that taking the time to hire someone based on their personality and soft skills will dramatically save costs in the long run. </p>

               <p>We want people to slow down instead of ramp up. The idea that you can do more with less people is often quoted, rarely understood. The answer to solving a problem faster by adding more people only works if the output is predictable, like a factory worker. </p>

               <p>The truth is, there is no future for factory workers. There will only be a future for people that can solve complex problems. How will you measure their output? We believe that you do not have to - that you should not WANT to. Good people make a good product. </p>

               <p>We work only with companies and people we believe understand this mindset. By ensuring that both parties shares a common ground we can guarantee a substantial increase in probability that a “match” will be found. 
               We extensively interview both company and job-seeker, to get a sense of their values and to understand what motivates them. We believe it is no longer a matter of technical skills, but that culture-fit should be the first and foremost priority. </p>
